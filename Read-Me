# Desktop-Cleaner
What The Project Is
This project is a python script that is automated.

What It Does
The user sets settings and creates the file paths for what they want the script to go through and organize.
Based on setting the the user sets for time, days, file paths, file types, and days until deletion the script just runs in the background and then sorts the files.

How To Use
The user first needs to create the file paths and define them so that the script knows where to store the organized files.
It is also important to define the file types that the user wants to be organized.
Then the user needs to set the settings for how long they want the files to sit before they are organized and eventually deleted.
After this the user can set what time they want the script to organize everything.
After all of the settings and file paths are defined the user just needs to run the script and continue to let it run in the background for an automated hands free cleaner.
